# Market-Segmentation
Market segmentation analysis to determine the ideal location of a franchise fast-food restaurant using elbow plot, k-means clustering and population demographic information.


## Who is the Customer?

### How do people choose a fast-food restaurant to visit?
 - Most prefer convenience in the form of cost and location. In the Sticks Kebob story, it suggests the younger crowd or customers with children under 13 would look to lower cost and close in location whereas the older adults may prefer more of a cuisine experience, with not so much emphasis on price and location.

### Sticks Customers based on the survey:
 - Care about convenience, value, taste, healthy options, and consistency compared to non-sticks customers
 - Are not as concerned about variety, staff, ambiance and community
 - Customers usually in the 26-40 range with kids
 - Household Income level around $50,000


## Difference Between Customers and Non-Customers

 - Sticks customers are much more health conscious
 - More business professionals and educators are customers.
 - Customer household income is higher, they are younger and have younger children than non-customers
 - Health benefits only variable close to statistically significant.
